Hello
, and I'm here to do a little basic introduction.

I was born and raised in the beautiful state of Florida, and I'm a recent college graduate from University of Florida with a degree in Computer Science and Business. After graduating, I decided to pursue a career in software development and have since been working with a local startup in the Tampa Bay area.

My current primary focus is web development, specifically using Node.js, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm also proficient in using React.js and Angular to create responsive single page applications.

I'm passionate about building tools that are both useful and user-friendly, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, playing with coding puzzles, going on hikes and hanging out with friends.
